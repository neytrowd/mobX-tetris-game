# Tetris Project

## A simple tetris in React / MobX

<br>

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game from the 80â€™s.
When a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space.

I made this small project to simulate the original 1984 version of TETRIS game. I saw a Youtube video showing the gameplay of this classic run on DVK-2 computer and thought I could implement it in browser and have some fun in the process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Prerequisities

You need to have node previously installed in your local

```

git clone
```
After complete, go inside the project you've just cloned

```

```

Now use npm to install all dependencies

After installing all dependencies, you are good to go. Just run the following command and the server will be up and running at port 3000:
